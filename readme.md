# Consilio Group

Using [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview), the entire website has been built using no front-end frameworks, using just HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and BootStrap.  

This is a plain vanilla _very basic_ web application, and leverages Azure Functions to perform couple of background jobs.
